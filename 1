                <h2>A poem awakens in the flood of urban information</h2>

                

                <p>On the streets of Toronto, ten poems stand in black and white— amid the flood of color, like breath itself, creating pockets of pause.</p>

                

                <p>This is a quiet resistance.<br>A collective awakening.</p>

                

                <p>When your gaze meets a line of poetry,<br>the city's frequency skips a beat.<br>In that second, the world recalibrates.</p>

                

                <p>Breathing becomes the most lucid revolution.</p>

                

                <p>This project is submitted for the FA/PANF 2500 course as "Project Three: Street Intervention — Public/Private Voice."</p>

                

                <p>The core task was to develop a method for generating ten standalone sentences and introducing them as "private voices" into "public space."</p>

                

                <p>My concept, "Awakening in the Torrent," frames the city as a saturated flood of advertisements and information. In response, I created ten black-and-white poetic lines — each acting as a pause, a breath.</p>

                

                <p>I printed these verses and placed, pasted, or installed them across downtown Toronto: on bulletin boards, in phone booths, against walls.</p>

                

                <p>This website serves as a visual diary of the intervention — tracing the journey from conception and production to final placement — capturing the moments when these private voices were discovered in public view.</p>
